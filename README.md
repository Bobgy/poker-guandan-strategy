## About Guan-Dan

Guan4 Dan4 is a Chinese card game whose name means throwing eggs. It originated in Huaian, Jiangsu Province and is probably the most popular climbing game in Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces nearby.

## About this repo

This was started as a cpp program using dfs with _heavy_ pruning optimization (lol) to calculate best (min hands) strategy for the card game, Guan Dan.

Now I've recently built a mobile friendly web app with react-native-web using the cpp module to calculate strategy. The app is published as a PWA in https://bobgy.github.io/poker-guandan-strategy/.
