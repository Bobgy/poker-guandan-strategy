# poker-guandan-strategy

This was started as a cpp program using dfs with _heavy_ optimization (lol) to calculate best (min hands) strategy for a variant of poker called guandan.

Now I've built a web app with react-native-web as UI for the cpp module. It is published in https://bobgy.github.io/poker-guandan-strategy/.
